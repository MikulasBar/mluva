Summary â€” things to include to make the project release-ready:

Project metadata and docs

README.md (install, quick start, usage, examples)
CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog / semantic-release style)
LICENSE (e.g. MIT/Apache-2.0)
CONTRIBUTING.md (how to contribute, coding style, tests)
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
SECURITY.md (reporting vulnerabilities)
docs/ or book/ (language spec, compiler architecture, CLI reference)
examples/ (small projects demonstrating imports, modules, build)
man/ or cli-reference.md (optional)
Repo housekeeping

.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ and .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
.gitattributes, .editorconfig, rustfmt.toml, clippy.toml
CI badges in README
Tests & quality

Unit tests inside src (#[cfg(test)]) and integration tests in tests/
Doc tests in public API docs
Tests exercising CLI (cargo run -- args) or using assert_cmd
Continuous checks: cargo fmt -- --check, cargo clippy, cargo test
Optional: code coverage publishing
Packaging & release artifacts

Produce zip/tarball that is ready-to-run: structure e.g.
bin/mluva (or bin/mluva.exe on Windows)
examples/
README.md
Include SHA256 checksums and (optionally) GPG signature
Cross-platform builds

Use GitHub Actions matrix (ubuntu, macos, windows)
Build release binaries (cargo build --release) for host targets
Optionally use cross or setup cross-compilation toolchains for extra targets
Release automation

GitHub Actions workflow triggered on tag (vX.Y.Z) to build, package and create GitHub Release + upload assets
Optionally generate CHANGELOG from PRs or use release-drafter
Distribution

GitHub Release ZIP (users download and unpack; bin/ is on PATH)
Optionally provide installers / Homebrew tap / Scoop manifest / winget
Minimal required files you should add (quick checklist)

README.md
CHANGELOG.md
LICENSE
CONTRIBUTING.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
docs/
examples/
tests/
.github/workflows/ci.yml
.github/workflows/release.yml
Example CI (PR/Push): run fmt check, clippy, test

Example release workflow (build + create GitHub Release with per-OS zips)

Notes and best practices (brief)

Use semantic version tags (v1.2.3). CI triggers on tags.
Release artifacts should be self-contained under bin/ so end users can put bin/ on PATH.
Keep the manifest (module hashes) in meta folder and include examples in the zip.
Document install/unpack steps in README and in a quick-start section.
Run tests and lint on PRs; run release build on tags.
Provide integration tests that simulate real projects (examples/) and ensure build produces expected bytecode.
If you want, I can:

provide README.md and CHANGELOG.md templates,
produce the exact release.yml adapted to your repo structure (targets, package name),
scaffold docs/ or an mdBook,
add sample packaging script to produce consistent dist/ layout.
Which of those do you want next?
